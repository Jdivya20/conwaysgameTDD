/**
 * ****************Conways Game Of Life***********************************
 * Initially, there is a board with some cells which may be alive or dead. 
 * Task is to generate the next generation of cells based on the following rules: 
 *     
 * Rule 1: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under
 * population. 
 * Rule 2:Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on
 * to the next generation. 
 * Rule 3: Any live cell with more than three live  neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation. 
 * Ruele 4: Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * 
 * Step 1 => find the no Of Neighbours that are alive; 
 * Step 2 => apply rules of game to get next genration by use the if conditions
 * to check all neighbors exluding it self as given video lecture
 * 
 * *************Rules of Life********************* 
 * Lonely cell will die ==> aliveNeighbours < 2 ;
 * Cell will die due to overpopulation ==> aliveNeighbours > 3 
 * A new cell will born ==> if currently dead cell have aliveNeighbours == 3
 
 Here we are creating and displaying the board using a 2d array.Later we count the number of cells in the current and 
 next generations.We take the input from the user and display the desired output.
